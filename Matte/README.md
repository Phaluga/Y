### Notes
Check the very top of `user.css` for quick configs

For Windows users, here's how to make the window controls' background match with the topbar background:  
Put this snippet into your `user.css`
```css
/* window controls background */
.Root__top-bar {
    background-image: linear-gradient(#4a5b6b, #4a5b6b); /* depends on the color */
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-position: top right;
    background-size: 135px 31px; /* depends on the set page zoom - this value is for 100% */
}
```
